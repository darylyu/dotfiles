dotfiles
========

These are some of my dotfiles. They're pretty lame.
---------------------------------------------------

I use at least four different machines in a day and making a new one
that I throw at the end of the day is not unusual. The goal is to have
the same configuration in any of the machines I use.

What I do is clone a local copy and then replace the existing
files with symbolic links to the local clone of this repository.
